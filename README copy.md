# XPR Delegation Demo

A comprehensive demonstration application for delegating votes to Block Producers on XPR Network. This application showcases wallet integration, vote delegation, resource management, token transfers, and blockchain interaction using Proton Web SDK.

## Overview

The XPR Delegation Demo is a production-ready React application that provides developers with a practical example of blockchain interaction on the XPR Network. The application demonstrates best practices for wallet integration, transaction signing, and resource management in a decentralized environment.

## Usage Guide

### Wallet Connection
1. Install WebAuth or Anchor wallet in your browser
2. Access the application and click "Connect Wallet"
3. Select your preferred wallet provider
4. Grant necessary permissions for signing transactions

### Vote Delegation
1. Ensure you have XPR tokens staked for voting power
2. Select Block Producers from the provided list
3. Review and confirm delegation transaction
4. Monitor vote status updates in real-time

### Resource Management
1. View current account balances and XPR token allocations
2. Stake XPR tokens for network resources
3. Monitor XPR staking status
4. Unstake XPR tokens when no longer needed

### Token Transfers
1. Select token from available balances (XPR, USDC, etc.)
2. Enter destination account and transfer amount
3. Add optional memo for transfer
4. Confirm and execute transfer transaction
5. Monitor transfer status and view transaction details
